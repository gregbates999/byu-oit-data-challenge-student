Student Data Queries
====================
1. How many students are enrolled in a course on a specific day?

Given TargetCourseId
Given TargetDate

Select TargetDate as ReportDate, c.CourseTitle, count(*) as EnrolledStudentCount
From Semesters sem
	join Cources c on c.SemesterId = sem.SemesterId
	join Enrollments e on e.CourseId = c.CourseId
Where TargetDate >= sem.StartDate and TargetDate <= sem.EndDate
	and TargetCourseId = c.CourseId
	and e.ActiveEnrollment = 1
Group By c.CourseTitle;



2. How many grades does a given instructor need to turn in?

Given TargetInstructorId
Given TargetSemesterId

Select count(*)
From TeachingSchedule sched
	join Courses c on c.CourseId = sched.CourseId
	join Enrollments e on e.CourseId = c.CourseId
	join Semesters sem on sem.SemesterId = c.SemesterId
Where TargetInstructorId = sched.InstructorId
	and e.ActiveEnrollment = 1 and e.Auditing <> 1
	and GetDate() >= sem.StartDate and GetDate() <= sem.EndDate;

3. What is the GPA of an individual student for a given semester?

Given TargetStudentId
Given TargetSemesterId

Select Sum(e.Credits * e.CourseGpa) / Sum(e.Credits)
From Semesters sem
	join Courses c on c.SemesterId = sem.SemesterId
	join Enrollments e on e.CourseId = c.CourseId
Where TargetSemesterId = sem.SemesterId
	and TargetStudentId = st.StudentId
	and e.Auditing <> 1 and e.ActiveEnrollment = 1 and Grade <> "I"


4. What is the cumulative GPA of an individual student?

Given TargetStudentId

Select Sum(e.Credits * e.CourseGpa) / Sum(e.Credits)
From Students st
	join Enrollments e on e.StudentId = st.StudentId
Where TargetStudentId = st.StudentId
	and e.Auditing <> 1 and e.Grade <> "I";


5. How many students passed their courses each semester?

Select sem.StartDate, sem.EndDate, count(*) as PassedStudentCount
From Semesters sem
	join Courses c on c.SemesterId = sem.SemesterId
	join Enrollments e on e.CourseId = c.CourseId
Where e.Auditing <> 1 and e.Pass = 1
Group By sem.StartDate, sem.EndDate
Order By sem.StartDate;

6. How does daily enrollment activity during last semesterâ€™s open enrollment period compare to the same period the year prior?

Given CurSemesterId
Given PrevSemesterId

Select sem1.EnrollStartDate as CurrentSemesterEnrollmentPeriodStart,
(
	Select Count(*) / Count(Distinct(snap.SnapshotDate))
	From Semesters sem1
		join Courses c1 on c1.SemesterId = sem1.SemesterId
		join Enrollments e1 on e1.CourseId = c1.CourseId
		join ActiveEnrollmentSnapshots snap1 on snap1.StudentId = e1.StudentId
			and snap1.CourseId = e1.CourseId
	Where CurSemesterId = sem1.SemesterId
) as CurrentAverageDailyChanges, 
sem2.EnrollStartDate as PriorSemesterEnrollmentPeriodStart,
(
	Select Count(*) / Count(Distinct(snap.SnapshotDate))
	From Semesters sem2
		join Courses c2 on c2.SemesterId = sem2.SemesterId
		join Enrollments e2 on e2.CourseId = c2.CourseId
